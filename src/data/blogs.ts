        <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">How Rooftop Solar Can Cut Your Electricity Bills by 80% in Tripura</h1>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Electricity bills are rising every year, especially in Northeast India. Households and businesses in Tripura are searching for sustainable, long-term solutions to reduce costs. Rooftop solar systems have emerged as the most effective way to cut power bills while ensuring energy independence.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How Rooftop Solar Works</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Rooftop solar systems capture sunlight using photovoltaic (PV) panels and convert it into usable electricity. The power can be used instantly or exported to the grid under the net-metering policy, which credits excess generation against your consumption.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Massive Savings Potential</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">On average, a 5 kW solar rooftop system can generate around 600â€“700 units per month in Tripura's climate. At a tariff of â‚¹8 per unit, this translates into savings of â‚¹4,800â€“â‚¹5,600 per monthâ€”or nearly â‚¹60,000 per year. Over 25 years, households can save up to â‚¹15â€“20 lakhs.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Government Support Makes It Affordable</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">With government subsidies like the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, the upfront cost of solar is reduced by 30â€“40%. Most households recover their investment in 3â€“5 years, after which electricity is practically free.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Environmental Benefits</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Switching to solar also means reducing carbon emissions by up to 6 tons annually for a 5 kW system. This makes solar a win-win for both your pocket and the planet.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Take Action Today</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Unlike traditional string inverters, microinverters are installed under each solar panel, converting DC to AC at the source. This revolutionary approach offers numerous advantages for solar installations.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Key Advantages of Enphase:</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Higher Efficiency:</strong> Each panel works independently, so shading on one panel doesn't affect others</li>
          <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Low DC voltage reduces fire risks</li>
          <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Real-time performance tracking for each panel</li>
          <li><strong>Durability:</strong> 25-year warranty compared to 8â€“10 years for string inverters</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Tripura Homes Benefit:</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Given frequent partial shading (trees, buildings) in Tripura's residential areas, Enphase microinverters ensure maximum power output even when some panels are shaded.</p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Tripura's heavy monsoon can reduce solar output if systems aren't maintained properly. Here are 5 practical tips to ensure optimal performance during the rainy season:</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Regular Cleaning</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Remove dust, leaves, and bird droppings that can accumulate on panels and reduce efficiency. Clean panels can improve output by up to 15%.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Check Drainage</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Ensure rainwater doesn't stagnate on panels. Proper drainage prevents water damage and maintains panel efficiency.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Inspect Wiring</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Moisture can damage cables and connections. Get professional checks to prevent electrical issues and ensure safety.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Trim Surrounding Trees</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Prevent shading and leaf accumulation by keeping vegetation around your solar installation well-maintained.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Professional AMC</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Annual Maintenance Contracts ensure performance during challenging weather conditions with regular professional inspections.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion:</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">A little care ensures your solar system continues to deliver maximum efficiency during the rainy season, protecting your investment and maximizing returns.</p>
