- **Method**: Use soft brushes and mild soap with deionized water
- **Safety**: Always prioritize safety - consider professional cleaning for roof-mounted systems

## Performance Monitoring

### System Monitoring Tools
Modern solar systems include monitoring capabilities:
- **Production Tracking**: Monitor daily, monthly, and annual energy production
- **Performance Alerts**: Receive notifications when system performance drops
- **Component Monitoring**: Track individual panel and inverter performance

### What to Watch For
- **Sudden Production Drops**: May indicate equipment failure or shading issues
- **Gradual Decline**: Normal aging vs. maintenance issues
- **Weather Impact**: Understanding how weather affects performance

## Professional Inspections

### Annual Inspections Should Include:
- **Electrical Connections**: Check for loose or corroded connections
- **Physical Condition**: Inspect panels for cracks, chips, or damage
- **Mounting System**: Ensure rails and hardware remain secure
- **Inverter Performance**: Verify proper operation of all system components

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Shading Problems
- **Tree Growth**: Trim branches that cast shadows on panels
- **New Construction**: Monitor for new buildings or structures causing shade

### Equipment Failures
- **Inverter Issues**: Most common failure point in solar systems
- **Panel Degradation**: Normal aging vs. premature failure

## Conclusion

With proper maintenance, solar panel systems provide reliable, clean energy for decades. Regular cleaning, monitoring, and professional inspections ensure optimal performance and protect your investment.
